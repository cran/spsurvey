_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

   sites: a data frame consisting of two variables: the first variable
          is  site IDs and the second variable is a logical vector
          indicating which  sites to use in the analysis.  If this data
          frame is not provided,   then the data frame will be created,
          where (1) site IDs are obtained   either from the design
          argument, the siteID argument, or both (when   siteID is a
          formula); and (2) a variable named use.sites that contains
          the  value TRUE for all sites is created.   The default is
          NULL.

  subpop: a data frame describing sets of populations and
          subpopulations  for which estimates will be calculated.  The
          first variable is site   IDs and each subsequent variable
          identifies a Type of population,   where the variable name is
          used to identify Type.  A Type variable   identifies each
          site with one of the subpopulations of that Type.  If    this
          data frame is not provided, then the data frame will be
          created,   where (1) site IDs are obtained either from the
          design argument, the   siteID argument, or both (when siteID
          is a formula); and (2) a single Type  variable named
          all.sites that contains the value "All Sites" for all sites 
          is created.  The default is NULL.

  design: a data frame consisting of design variables.  If variable
          names  are provided as formulas in the corresponding
          arguments, then the  formulas are interpreted using this data
          frame.  If this data frame is  not provided, then the data
          frame will be created from inputs to the  design variables in
          the argument list.  The default is NULL.  If  variable names
          are not provided as formulas, then variables should be  named
          as follows:
           siteID = site IDs
           wgt = final adjusted weights
           xcoord = x-coordinates for location
           ycoord = y-coordinates for location
           stratum = stratum codes
           cluster = stage one sampling unit codes
           wgt1 = final adjusted stage one weights
           xcoord1 = stage one x-coordinates for location
           ycoord1 = stage one y-coordinates for location
           support = support values
           swgt = size-weights
           swgt1 = stage one size-weights

data.cat: a data frame of categorical response variables.  The first 
          variable is site IDs.  Subsequent variables are response
          variables. Missing data (NA) is allowed.  The default is
          NULL.

data.cont: a data frame of continuous response variables.  The first 
          variable is site IDs.  Subsequent variables are response
          variables. Missing data (NA) is allowed.  The default is
          NULL.

  siteID: site IDs.  This variable can be input directly or as a
          formula  and must be supplied either as this argument or in
          the design data  frame.  The default is NULL.

     wgt: the final adjusted weight (inverse of the sample inclusion
          probability) for each site, which is either the weight for a 
          single-stage sample or the stage two weight for a two-stage
          sample. The default is NULL.

   sigma: measurement error variance.  This variable must be a vector
          containing a value for each response variable and must have
          the names attribute set to identify the response variable
          names.  Missing data (NA) is allowed.  The default is NULL.

var.sigma: variance of the measurement error variance.  This variable
          must be a vector containing a value for each response
          variable and must have the names attribute set to identify
          the response variable names.  Missing data (NA) is allowed. 
          The default is NULL.

  xcoord: x-coordinate for location for each site, which is either the
          x-coordinate for a single-stage sample or the stage two 
          x-coordinate for a two-stage sample.  The default is NULL.

  ycoord: y-coordinate for location for each site, which is either the
          y-coordinate for a single-stage sample or the stage two 
          y-coordinate for a two-stage sample.  The default is NULL.

 stratum: the stratum codes.  This variable can be input directly or as
          a  formula.  The default is NULL.

 cluster: the stage one sampling unit (primary sampling unit or
          cluster)  codes.  This variable can be input directly or as a
          formula.  The  default is NULL.

N.cluster: the number of stage one sampling units in the resource,
          which  is required for calculation of finite and continuous
          population  correction factors for a two-stage sample.  For a
          stratified sample  this variable must be a vector containing
          a value for each stratum and must have the names attribute
          set to identify the stratum codes.  The default is NULL.

    wgt1: the final adjusted stage one weights.  This variable can be
          input  directly or as a formula.  The default is NULL.

 xcoord1: the stage one x-coordinates for location.  This variable can
          be  input directly or as a formula.  The default is NULL.

 ycoord1: the stage one y-coordinates for location.  This variable can
          be  input directly or as a formula.  The default is NULL.

 popsize: the known size of the resource - the total number of sampling
           units of a finite resource or the measure of an extensive
          resource, which is used to adjust estimators for the known
          size of a resource. This argument also is required for
          calculation of finite and continuous population correction
          factors for a single-stage sample.    The argument must be in
          the form of a list containing an element for    each
          population Type in the subpop data frame, where NULL is a
          valid    choice for a population Type.  The list must be
          named using the column   names for the population Types in
          subpop. If a population Type doesn't   contain
          subpopulations, then each element of the list is either a  
          single value for an unstratified sample or a vector
          containing a value   for each stratum for a stratified
          sample, where elements of the vector are named using the
          stratum codes.  If a population Type contains 
          subpopulations, then each element of the list is a list
          containing an  element for each subpopulation, where the list
          is named using the  subpopulation names.  The element for
          each subpopulation will be  either a single value for an
          unstratified sample or a named vector of  values for a
          stratified sample.  The default is NULL.

           Example popsize for a stratified sample:
           popsize = list("Pop 1"=c("Stratum 1"=750, "Stratum 2"=500,
          "Stratum 3"=250),
           "Pop2"=list("SubPop 1"=c("Stratum 1"=350, "Stratum 2"=250,
          "Stratum 3"=150),
           "SubPop 2"=c("Stratum 1"=250, "Stratum 2"=150, "Stratum
          3"=100),
           "SubPop 3"=c("Stratum 1"=150, "Stratum 2"=150, "Stratum
          3"=75)),
           "Pop 3"=NULL)

           Example popsize for an unstratified sample:
           popsize = list("Pop 1"=1500, "Pop2"=list("SubPop 1"=750,
          "SubPop 2"=500, "SubPop 3"=375), "Pop 3"=NULL)

stage1size: the known size of the stage one sampling units of a two-
          stage sample, which is required for calculation of finite and
            continuous population correction factors for a two-stage
          sample and  must have the names attribute set to identify the
          stage one sampling  unit codes.  For a stratified sample, the
          names attribute must be set to identify both stratum codes
          and stage one sampling unit codes using a convention where
          the two codes are separated by the & symbol, e.g., "Stratum
          1&Cluster 1".  The default is NULL.

popcorrect: a logical value that indicates whether finite or continuous
           population correction factors should be employed during
          variance  estimation, where TRUE = use the correction factors
          and FALSE = do not  use the correction factors.  The default
          is FALSE.

 support: the support value for each site - the value one (1) for a 
          site from a finite resource or the measure of the sampling
          unit   associated with a site from an extensive resource,
          which is required   for calculation of finite and continuous
          population correction   factors.  This variable can be input
          directly or as a formula.  The default is NULL.

sizeweight: a logical value that indicates whether size-weights should 
          be used in the analysis, where TRUE = use the size-weights
          and FALSE =  do not use the size-weights.  The default is
          FALSE.

    swgt: the size-weight for each site, which is the stage two
          size-weight  for a two-stage sample.  This variable can be
          input directly or as a  formula.  The default is NULL.

   swgt1: the stage one size-weight for each site.  This variable can
          be  input directly or as a formula.  The default is NULL.

unitsize: the known sum of the size-weights of the resource.  The 
          argument must be in the form of a list containing an element
          for each   population Type in the subpop data frame, where
          NULL is a valid choice   for a population Type.  The list
          must be named using the column   names for population Types
          in subpop.  If a population Type doesn't   contain
          subpopulations, then each element of the list is either a  
          single value for an unstratified sample or a vector
          containing a value   for each stratum for a stratified
          sample, where elements of the vector are named using the
          stratum codes.  If a population Type contains 
          subpopulations, then each element of the list is a list
          containing an  element for each subpopulation, where the list
          is named using the  subpopulation names.  The element for
          each subpopulation will be  either a single value for an
          unstratified sample or a named vector of  values for a
          stratified sample.  The default is NULL.

 vartype: the choice of variance estimator, where "Local" = local mean
          estimator and "SRS" = SRS estimator.  The default is "Local".

    conf: the confidence level.  The default is 95%.

  pctval: the set of values at which percentiles are estimated.  The 
          default set is: {5, 10, 25, 50, 75, 90, 95}.

_V_a_l_u_e:

     data.cont data frames will exist.  Depending upon values of the
     input variables, other elements in the output may be  NULL.  The

           sample and FALSE = not a two-stage sample

        *  'pcfactor.ind' - a logical value that indicates whether the
