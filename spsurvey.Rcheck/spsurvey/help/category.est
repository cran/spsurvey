_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     This function estimates proportion (expressed as percent) and size
     of a resource in each of a set of categories and can also be used
     to estimate proportion and size for site status categories.  Upper
     and lower confidence bounds also are estimated.

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

  catvar: the value of the categorical response variable or the site
          status for each site.

     wgt: the final adjusted weight (inverse of the sample inclusion
          probability) for each site, which is either the weight for a 
          single-stage sample or the stage two weight for a two-stage
          sample.

       x: x-coordinate for location for each site, which is either the
          x-coordinate for a single-stage sample or the stage two 
          x-coordinate for a two-stage sample.  The default is NULL.

       y: y-coordinate for location for each site, which is either the
          y-coordinate for a single-stage sample or the stage two 
          y-coordinate for a two-stage sample.  The default is NULL.

 stratum: the stratum for each site.  The default is NULL.

 cluster: the stage one sampling unit (primary sampling unit or
          cluster)  code for each site.  The default is NULL.

N.cluster: the number of stage one sampling units in the resource,
          which  is required for calculation of finite and continuous
          population  correction factors for a two-stage sample.  For a
          stratified sample  this variable must be a vector containing
          a value for each stratum and must have the names attribute
          set to identify the stratum codes.  The default is NULL.

    wgt1: the final adjusted stage one weight for each site.  The
          default is NULL.

      x1: the stage one x-coordinate for location for each site.  The
          default is NULL.

      y1: the stage one y-coordinate for location for each site.  The
          default is NULL.

 popsize: the known size of the resource - the total number of sampling
           units of a finite resource or the measure of an extensive
          resource, which is required for calculation of finite and
          continuous population  correction factors for a single-stage
          sample.  This variable is also  used to adjust estimators for
          the known size of a resource.  For a stratified sample this
          variable must be a vector containing a value  for each
          stratum and must have the names attribute set to identify the
          stratum codes.  The default is NULL.

stage1size: the known size of the stage one sampling units of a two-
          stage sample, which is required for calculation of finite and
            continuous population correction factors for a two-stage
          sample and  must have the names attribute set to identify the
          stage one sampling  unit codes.  For a stratified sample, the
          names attribute must be set to identify both stratum codes
          and stage one sampling unit codes using a convention where
          the two codes are separated by the # symbol, e.g., "Stratum
          1#Cluster 1".  The default is NULL.

 support: the support value for each site - the value one (1) for a 
          site from a finite resource or the measure of the sampling
          unit   associated with a site from an extensive resource,
          which is required   for calculation of finite and continuous
          population correction   factors.  The default is NULL.

    swgt: the size-weight for each site, which is the stage two
          size-weight  for a two-stage sample.  The default is NULL.

   swgt1: the stage one size-weight for each site.  The default is
          NULL.

unitsize: the known sum of the size-weights of the resource, which for
          a  stratified sample must be a vector containing a value for
          each stratum  and must have the names attribute set to
          identify the stratum codes.   The default is NULL.

 vartype: the choice of variance estimator, where "Local" = local mean
          estimator and "SRS" = SRS estimator.  The default is "Local".

    conf: the confidence level.  The default is 95%.

check.ind: a logical value that indicates whether compatability
          checking of the input values is conducted, where TRUE =
          conduct  compatibility checking and FALSE = do not conduct
          compatibility  checking.  The default is TRUE.

warn.ind: a logical value that indicates whether warning messages were
          generated, where TRUE = warning messages were generated and
          FALSE = warning messages were not generated.  The default is
          NULL.

 warn.df: a data frame for storing warning messages.  The default is
          NULL.

warn.vec: a vector that contains names of the population type, the
          subpopulation, and an indicator.  The default is NULL.

_D_e_t_a_i_l_s:

     Proportion estimates are calculated using the Horvitz-Thompson
     ratio estimator, i.e., the ratio of two Horvitz-Thompson
     estimators.  The numerator of the ratio estimates the size of the
     category.  The denominator of the ratio estimates the size of the
     resource.   Variance estimates for the proportion estimates are
     calculated using either the local mean variance estimator or the
     simple random sampling (SRS) variance estimator.  The choice of
     variance estimator is subject to user control.  The local mean
     variance estimator requires the x-coordinate and the y-coordinate
     of each site.  The SRS variance estimator uses the independent 
     random sample approximation to calculate joint inclusion
     probabilities.   Confidence bounds are calculated using a Normal
     distribution multiplier.  For a finite resource size is the number
     of units in the resource.  For an extensive resource size is the 
     measure (extent) of the resource, i.e., length, area, or volume. 
     Size  estimates are calculated using the Horvitz- Thompson
     estimator.  Variance  estimates for the size estimates are
     calculated using either the local mean  variance estimator or the
     SRS variance estimator. The function can  accommodate a stratified
     sample.  For a stratified sample, separate estimates  and standard
     errors are calculated for each stratum, which are used to produce 
     estimates and standard errors for all strata combined.  Strata
     that contain a  single value are removed.  For a stratified
     sample, when either the size of the resource or the sum of the
     size-weights for the resource is provided for each  stratum, those
     values are used as  stratum weights for calculating the  estimates
     and standard errors for all strata combined.  In addition, when 
     either of those known values is provided for each stratum, size
     estimates are  obtained by multiplying the proportion estimate,
     i.e., the Horvitz-Thompson  ratio estimator, by the known value
     for the stratum.  For a stratified sample  when neither the size
     of the  resource nor the sum of the size-weights of the  resource
     is provided for  each stratum, estimated values are used as
     stratum  weights for calculating  the estimates and standard
     errors for all strata  combined.  The function can accommodate
     single-stage and two-stage samples for  both stratified and
     unstratified sampling designs.  Finite population and  continuous
     population correction factors can be utilized in variance 
     estimation.  The function checks for compatibility of input values
     and removes missing values.

_V_a_l_u_e:

     If the function was called by the cat.analysis function, then
     value is a list containing the following components:

        *  'Results' - a data frame containing estimates and confidence
           bounds

        *  'warn.ind' - a logical value indicating whether warning
           messages were generated

        *  'warn.df' - a data frame containing warning messages

     If the function was called directly, then value is a data frame
     containing estimates and confidence bounds.
