\section{CHANGES IN spsurvey VERSION 2.2 (Released 2011-05-23)}{
  \subsection{NEW FEATURES}{
    \itemize{
      \item Created vignettes that present analyses of GRTS survey designs for 
      finite, linear, and areal resources.

      \item Created a function named \code{attrisk.analysis} that conducts 
      attributable risk analysis for a collection of response variables 
      generated by a probability survey.

      \item Created functions named \code{attrisk.est} and \code{attrisk.var} to 
      calculate estimates of attributable risk and its associated variance.

      \item Modified function \code{relrisk.est} to change the way the relative 
      risk estimate is calculated for a stratified sample.

      \item Modified functions \code{cat.analysis}, \code{cont.analysis}, 
      \code{cont.cdftest}, \code{relrisk.analysis}, \code{category.est}, 
      \code{cdf.est}, \code{cdf.decon}, \code{total.est}, \code{cdf.test}, 
      \code{relrisk.est}, \code{catvar.prop}, \code{catvar.size}, 
      \code{cdfvar.prop}, \code{cdfvar.total}, \code{cdfvar.size.prop}, 
      \code{cdfvar.size.total}, \code{dcdfvar.prop}, \code{dcdfvar.total}, 
      \code{dcdfvar.size.prop}, \code{dcdfvar.size.total}, \code{total.var}, 
      \code{cdfvar.test}, and \code{relrisk.var} to allow variance estimates to 
      be calculated when a two stage sample has stage one sampling units that 
      contain a single stage two sampling unit.  Variance for those stage one 
      sampling units is calculated using the mean of the variance estimates for 
      stage one sampling units that contain two or more stage two sampling 
      units. 

      \item Modified function \code{grtslin} to improve efficiency of sample 
      point selection.  Created a C function named \code{insideLinearGridCell} 
      that, for each grid cell selected to receive a sample point, returns the 
      ID value for shapefile records contained in the cell and the clipped 
      length of the polyline segments within the cell for each record.  Created 
      a C function named \code{pickLinearSamplePoints} that selects sample 
      points.

      \item Modified function \code{grtsarea} to improve efficiency of sample 
      point selection.  Created a C function named \code{insideAreaGridCell} 
      that, for each grid cell selected to receive a sample point, returns the 
      ID value for shapefile records contained in the cell and the clipped area 
      of the polygon within the cell for each record.  Created a C function 
      named \code{pickAreaSamplePoints} that selects sample points.
    }
  }

  \subsection{BUG FIXES}{
    \itemize{
      \item Modified function \code{input.check} to include determination of 
      whether a valid value was provided for argument \code{vartype}.

      \item Modified function \code{grts} so that correct survey design weights 
      are created for linear and areal designs when the type of random selection 
      is "continuous".

      \item Modified functions \code{grtspts}, \code{grtslin}, and 
      \code{grtsarea} to execute without error for a stratum sample size of one.

      \item Modified function \code{dframe.check} to terminate execution when 
      missing values are encountered in the logical variable of the sites data 
      frame. 
    }
  }
}


\section{CHANGES IN spsurvey VERSION 2.1 (Released 2009-10-29)}{
  \subsection{NEW FEATURES}{
    \itemize{
      \item Created vignettes that present examples of GRTS survey designs for 
      finite, linear, and areal resources.

      \item Created a function named \code{geodalbers} that projects latitude 
      and longitude (spheroid) models of the globe to Albers projection in the 
      plane.

      \item Modified function \code{dsgnsum} to produce summary tables for the 
      actual set of design variables that are present rather than a standard set 
      of design variables.

      \item Modified function \code{dframe.check} to terminate execution when 
      missing site ID values or repeated site ID values are encountered in the 
      \code{sites}, \code{design}, \code{subpop}, \code{data.cat}, 
      \code{data.cont}, or \code{data.rr} data frames.  Note that 
      \code{dframe.check} is called by functions \code{cat.analysis}, 
      \code{cont.analysis}, \code{cont.cdftest}, and \code{relrisk.analysis}.
    }
  }

  \subsection{BUG FIXES}{
    \itemize{
      \item Modified function \code{cont.cdftest} to correct an error caused by 
      improper handling of an empty subpopulation.

      \item Modified function \code{relrisk.analysis} to correct an error 
      resulting from inclusion of more than one response variable in the 
      \code{response.var} argument.
    }
  }
}

\section{CHANGES IN spsurvey VERSION 2.0 (Released 2008-06-16)}{
  \subsection{NEW FEATURES}{
    \itemize{
      \item Eliminated use of argument \code{unitsize} (known sum of 
      size-weights) by package functions.  Restricted argument \code{popsize} to 
      provide only the known size of the resource for use in ratio adjustment of 
      estimators.  Created a new argument named \code{pcfsize} to provide 
      resource size for calculation of finite and continuous population 
      correction factors for single-stage samples.

      \item Modified functions \code{cat.analysis}, \code{cont.analysis}, 
      \code{cont.cdftest}, and \code{relrisk.analysis} to add logical variables 
      to their argument lists that specify use of finite or continuous 
      population correction factors or use of size-weights in analysis routines.

      \item Modified functions \code{category.est}, \code{cdf.decon}, 
      \code{cdf.est}, \code{cdf.test}, \code{relrisk.est} and \code{total.est} 
      to add logical variables to their argument lists that specify use of 
      finite or continuous population correction factors or use of size-weights.
    }
  }

  \subsection{BUG FIXES}{
    \itemize{
      \item Modified function \code{irs} to eliminate checking for existence of 
      x-coordinates and y-coordinates when the type of frame is "finite" and the 
      frame is included in the \code{att.frame} data frame.

      \item Modified C functions \code{parseFields} and \code{readDbfFile} to 
      ensure that blank values in the shapefile attributes (dbf) file are 
      converted to R missing values (NA).

      \item Modified C function \code{writeDbfFile} to output blank values for R 
      missing values (NA) when creating the shapefile attributes (dbf) file.

      \item Modified functions \code{grts}, \code{irs}, and \code{sp2shape} to 
      ensure that an output shapefile attributes (dbf) file containing character 
      variables with missing values can be read without error.

  }
}

\section{CHANGES IN spsurvey VERSION 1.7 (Released 2007-11-09)}{
  \subsection{NEW FEATURES}{
    \itemize{
      \item Created a function named \code{cont.cdftest} that tests for 
      differences between cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) for pairs of 
      subpopulations within a population \code{Type} for a collection of 
      response variables generated by a probability survey.  Also, modified 
      function \code{cdf.test} so that it is consistent with functions that are 
      called by high-level functions \code{cat.analysis} and 
      \code{cont.analysis}.

      \item Modified function \code{grtspts} so that, when source of the frame 
      equals "att.frame", the current number of grid levels for hierarchical 
      randomization and the final number of grid levels is printed to the 
      console while the function is executing.

      \item Created a function named \code{relrisk.analysis} that conducts 
      relative risk analysis for a collection of response variables generated by 
      a probability survey.  Also, renamed function \code{relrisk} to 
      \code{relrisk.est} and modified the function so that it is consistent with 
      functions that are called by high-level functions \code{cat.analysis} and 
      \code{cont.analysis}.

      \item Modified function \code{grtspts} and C function \code{numLevels} to 
      terminate the algorithm for determining the number of grid levels for 
      hierarchical randomization when the maximum value of total inclusion 
      probability for the grid cells stops changing as the number of levels 
      increases.

      \item Created functions named \code{cdf.plot} and \code{cont.cdfplot} that 
      create cumulative distribution function (CDF) plots using the data frame 
      named "CDF" contained in the output object created by function 
      \code{cont.analysis}.  Function \code{cdf.plot} creates a single CDF plot, 
      and function \code{cont.cdfplot} creates a set of CDF plots.

      \item Created a function named \code{read.sas} that can read SAS datasets 
      or a SAS XPORT (transport) file.
    }
  }

  \subsection{BUG FIXES}{
    \itemize{
      \item Modified C functions \code{intersect}, \code{linSampleIRS}, 
      \code{lintFcn}, and \code{linSample} to eliminate warning messages that 
      were generated during package creation.

      \item Modified function \code{grts} so that argument \code{do.sample} 
      provides a value for each stratum.

      \item Modified C functions \code{getRecordShapeSizes}, \code{readDbfFile}, 
      \code{parsePoints}, \code{parsePointsZ}, \code{parsePointsM}, 
      \code{parsePolygon}, \code{parsePolygonZ}, and \code{parsePolygonM} to 
      generate error messages and terminate execution when a shapefile 
      containing a Null record is encountered.

      \item Modified functions \code{irslin} and \code{irsarea} in addition to C 
      function \code{getRecordIDs} to ensure that sample points are selected in 
      random order for linear and areal IRS designs.

      \item Modified function \code{grts} to ensure that, when the type of 
      random selection is "unequal", an oversample is apportioned correctly 
      whenever the category sample sizes are proportional to the oversample 
      size.

  }
}

\section{CHANGES IN spsurvey VERSION 1.6 (Released 2007-01-18)}{
  \subsection{NEW FEATURES}{
    \itemize{
      \item For C functions that read shapefiles from the current directory, 
      replaced calls to \code{_findfirst} and \code{_findnext} with code using 
      calls to \code{readdir}.  These changes were implemented to facilitate 
      portability of the package.

      \item Created a C function named \code{matchFiles} that determines whether 
      file names in the current directory have a desired file extension.  This 
      change was implemented to facilitate portability of the package.
    }
  }

  \subsection{BUG FIXES}{

      \code{data.frame} for the data slot of sp package objects belonging to 
      class \code{SpatialPointsDataFrame}.

      \item Modified functions \code{grts} and \code{irs} to print a warning 
      message when the type of frame equals "finite" and a stratum name in the 
      design list matches only a single value in the stratum column of the 
      attributes data frame.  For this case, function \code{grtspts} or 
      \code{irspts} is not called since the sample will be composed of a single 
      point.

      \item Modified functions \code{grts}, \code{grts}pts, \code{grtslin}, and 
      \code{grtsarea} to change the maximum value allowed for arguments startlev 
      (the initial number of hierarchical levels to use for the GRTS grid) and 
      maxlev (the maximum number of hierarchical levels to use for the GRTS 
      grid) from 12 to 11.

      \item Added an example polylines dataset to the data directory.

      \item Modified functions \code{grts} and \code{irs} to allow use of an sp 
      package object as the source of the frame.  An argument named 
      \code{sp.object} was added to the argument list for \code{grts} and 
      \code{irs}.

      \item Modified functions \code{grts}, \code{grtspts}, \code{grtslin}, 
      \code{grtsarea}, \code{irs}, \code{irspts}, \code{irslin}, and 
      \code{irsarea} to remove use of argument \code{xy.frame} as an option for 
      source of the frame.  Then modified functions \code{grts}, \code{grtspts}, 
      \code{irs}, and \code{irspts} to allow incorporation of frame coordinates 
      into the attributes data frame when the type of frame equals "finite".  
      Also, removed argument \code{elmsize} from functions \code{grts} and 
      \code{irs} since the argument no longer was required.

      values for elements of the frame provided in att.frame are unique.

      \item Modified functions \code{grts} and \code{irs} to ensure that valid 
      values are provided for the \code{panel} and \code{caty.n} arguments in 
      the design list.

    \itemize{
      \item Modified function \code{irsarea} and created a C function 
      \code{named getRecordIDs} to ensure that an IRS sample is selected when

  \subsection{BUG FIXES}{
    \itemize{
      \item Modified functions \code{grts} and \code{irs} to ensure that the 
      levels of \code{mdcaty} (the variable in the attributes data frame that 
      specifies the unequal probability category for each element in the frame) 
      are equivalent to the names in \code{caty.n} (the vector of sample sizes 
      for each category in \code{mdcaty}, which is required for each element of 
      the design list for which the selection type is "Unequal").

      \item Modified functions \code{grts} and \code{irs} to ensure that the
